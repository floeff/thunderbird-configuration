Configuration files for Mozilla Thunderbird

This repository contains my configuration files for Mozilla Thunderbird. Take it with a grain of salt and adapt to your needs, but I hope it helps you to set up a helpful configuration for yourself.

Feedback, suggestions, improvements and bug reports always welcome!

## Files and locations
The file *user.js* must be placed in your [profile directory](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-thunderbird-stores-user-data).

## Limitations
Settings done in *user.js* will, upon each restart of the program, override any contradicting local configuration you might have done either in the program's configuration dialog, or in [about:config](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/config-editor).
